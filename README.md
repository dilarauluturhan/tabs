## Features
I created this project to show off their work experience and details. I pull the data from an API and show the upload status. I aimed to demonstrate how to implement data management and inter-component communication using the basic concepts of react (useState, useEffect). I also included the React Icons library for the use of icons in this project.

## Design
In this project, I used Pure CSS for the design.

## Built With
